## Q. Create JSON data representing a Company Information.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a JSON file representing basic company information, including some general details like name, location, departments, and employees:

### JSON File Content (`company.json`)

```json
{
  "companyName": "Tech Solutions Inc.",
  "address": {
    "city": "Tech City",
    "state": "CA",
    "zipCode": "90210"
  },
  "contactInfo": {
    "phone": "+1-800-123-4567",
    "email": "info@techsolutions.com",
    "website": "https://www.techsolutions.com"
  },
  "departments": [
    {
      "name": "Engineering",
      "head": "Alice Johnson",
      "employees": 45
    },
    {
      "name": "Sales",
      "head": "Bob Thompson",
      "employees": 30
    },
    {
      "name": "Human Resources",
      "head": "Cathy Lin",
      "employees": 12
    }
  ],
  "founded": 2010,
  "isPublic": true
}
```

### Saving the JSON File
1. Open a text editor.
2. Create a similar file content.
3. Save the file as `company.json`.
